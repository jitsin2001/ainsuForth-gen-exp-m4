// On branch testing-gg- / post-release of 0.1.0

Release 0.1.0 on 5 August 2019.  Should be able to
talk to the M4 QSPI flashROM on ItsyBitsy M4 and
selected other SAMD51 targets in this series (Trellis M4,
Feather M4 Express).

Must be used with outdated Adafruit libs; current
libs (2019) are not (yet) supported.  Roll back to
October 2018 lib versions (see elsewhere for which
libs to roll back; this issue is limited to QSPI
flashROM support related compile) (remove the
requirement for QSPI flashROM support and the
compile issue *may* go away - untested).

The program has a small vocabulary related to reading
and writing to flashROM (SPI, or QSPI, for SAMD21 and
SAMD51 targets, respectively).

The program will replay formerly stored (forth) code
found in a single file in flashROM, as if a human had
typed it in.

It will also acquire new lines to this 'player piano'
code (by appending to an existing text file stored in
the filesystem on the flashROM).

Further, it can re-initialize this file to an empty
file (or pseudo-empty, with a single character stored
in it, or what-have-you) ;)

The flashROM must have been initialized somewhere else;
the program won't create a fileystem nor repair one.

There *might* be a limited facility available for this,
from within forth.  Something was done about this, though
the effort was incomplete, possibly.

See: the 'eflmkdir' word, for specifics, there. ;)
